# Socket Programming of a Chat Client-Server
<p align="justify">
    This is an implementation of a simple Chat Client and Chat Server in C. When a
    client joins a group, the server registers the client with the corresponding group.
    When a client requests to leave a group, the server removes the client from the
    corresponding group. When the server receives a send request message for a group, the
    server delivers the message to all members of the group.
